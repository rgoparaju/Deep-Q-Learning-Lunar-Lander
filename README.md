## Deep Q-Learning Lunar Lander

Special thanks to Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves at Super Data Science on Udemy for their course on Artificial Intelligence, and for teaching how to use the pytorch module in Python. The code in the 'lander_sequence.py' file is adapted from the course they teach, and modified by me to fit this particular project.  

In this project I am also using John Zelle's 'graphics.py,' an open-source file (licensed under GNU General Public License) that contains a simple library for basic shapes and animation. This file is included in the repo, so no additional download is required.

### Install instructions
In order for this project to run on your machine, first Python 3 must be installed, as well as the pytorch package. To install pytorch, visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and follow the instructions for your configuration.
