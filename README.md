## Deep Q-Learning Lunar Lander

Special thanks to Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves at Super Data Science on Udemy for their course on Artificial Intelligence, and for teaching how to use the pytorch module in Python. The code in the 'lander_sequence.py' file is adapted from the course they teach, and modified by me to fit this particular project.
